# capsnet-keras-jupyter-notebook
Jupyter notebook simplified version of https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras implementing the the paper:   
[Sara Sabour, Nicholas Frosst, Geoffrey E Hinton. Dynamic Routing Between Capsules. NIPS 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)   



This repo is expected to be used with an indepth article (Coming Soon!).

Proposed Table Contents for the article:
1. Introduction
2. Convolutional Neural Networks and Limitations
3. Capsule Networks - Architecture
4. Capsule Layer
5. Capsules
6. Routing by Agreement
7. Masking
8. Code walkthrough
and much more...
